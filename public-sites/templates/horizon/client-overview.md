# Horizon Template — Client Overview (Sample)

## Brand Snapshot
- **Owner**: Blanca (Bianca) Kleinfall, progressive-minded therapist based in Texas.
- **Practice**: Progressive Way Therapy — virtual-first individual therapy for adults statewide.
- **Mission**: Offer a safe, affirming space where marginalized adults can breathe, be themselves, and do the healing work that leaves them seen, heard, and empowered.
- **Approach**: Allyship-centered, trauma-informed sessions that combine validation, nervous system safety, and practical coping tools.

## Audience & Needs
- **Primary**: LGBTQIA+ adults in Texas who want non-faith-based therapy from a therapist who shares their progressive values.
- **Secondary**: BIPOC, immigrants, and first-generation clients balancing cultural expectations with personal wellbeing.
- **Tertiary**: Progressive-minded women navigating burnout, identity shifts, fertility journeys, miscarriage, or abortion care.
- **Shared Needs**: Immediate psychological safety, explicit inclusion, relief from carrying everything alone, and a therapist who understands the weight of systemic pressure.

## Positioning & Promise
- Blanca stands beside clients as a guide and ally, not above them as an expert.
- Sessions prioritize belonging, validation, and collaborative skill-building so clients leave grounded, understood, and resourced.
- Language is direct yet compassionate, acknowledging exhaustion without pathologizing identities or experiences.

## Voice & Tone Guidelines
- Warm, welcoming, and identity-forward; call audiences in by name (LGBTQ+, BIPOC, immigrants, non-faith-based adults).
- Empathetic and validating—recognize overwhelm and isolation before offering the path forward.
- Progressive and inclusive; avoid religious framing or clinical jargon.
- Empowering without urgency; CTAs invite at-your-pace engagement ("Book a free consultation," "Reach out when you're ready").

## Brand Pillars
1. **Safe Space** — Non-judgmental, trauma-informed care that honors lived experience and identities.
2. **Progressive Values** — Proudly inclusive, affirming, and non-religious therapy for adults statewide.
3. **Liberatory Healing** — Therapy as a way to reclaim identity, agency, and rest from systemic pressures.

## Visual & UX Direction
- Keep the current Horizon build aesthetic: soft purples, sage greens, and earthy neutrals with serif/sans-serif pairing.
- Preserve rounded cards, gentle gradients, and lucide-react iconography already in use.
- Maintain accessible contrast, generous whitespace, and calming motion cues that invite users to slow down.
- Photography should feel authentic and diverse, featuring LGBTQ+, BIPOC, immigrant, and multicultural stories.

## Navigation & Page Intent (Draft)
- **Home**: Immediate safe-space affirmation, core audience callouts, high-visibility consultation and inquiry CTAs.
- **About**: Blanca's story, lived experience, credentials, and progressive practice philosophy.
- **Services**: Individual therapy overview plus specialty focuses (anxiety, depression, trauma, LGBTQIA+, reproductive journeys, immigrant support).
- **Get Started**: Intake guidance, what to expect, appointment request flow, rates & insurance, privacy practices, FAQs.
- **Client Portal**: Direct access for existing clients with reminders of available resources (scheduling, paperwork, secure messaging).
- **Contact**: Invitation to reach out, Texas telehealth availability, preferred contact methods, hours, and alternative access accommodations.
