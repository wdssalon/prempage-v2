## Template
clarity

## Brand Snapshot
- **Practice**: Progressive Way Therapy PLLC, owned by Blanca Kleinfall, M.Ed., LPC.
- **Modality**: 100% telehealth; serves adult clients located anywhere in Texas.
- **Mission**: Deliver progressive, trauma-informed counseling that centers LGBTQIA+ folks, BIPOC communities, women, and clients seeking a non-religious therapeutic space.
- **Approach**: Direct, compassionate guidance that blends evidence-based modalities (EMDR, ketamine-assisted psychotherapy coordination, trauma-informed care) with psychoeducation and radical affirmation.

## Audience & Needs
- Adults in Texas navigating trauma, anxiety, depression, burnout, grief, relationship toxicity, or identity-based stressors.
- Individuals seeking clinicians who share progressive values and offer judgment-free support around gender, sexuality, reproductive choices, and immigration experiences.
- People who may be therapy-curious but hesitant—need reassurance, clarity on logistics, and quick access to consults.

## Voice & Tone Guidelines
- Conversational, candid, and validating; don’t shy away from plainspoken phrases when it adds warmth or solidarity.
- Balance friendly irreverence with professional steadiness—empower clients while reinforcing safety and competence.
- Prioritize inclusive, affirming language; call out oppressive dynamics without sensationalizing trauma.

## Service Pillars
- Trauma resolution (PTSD, abuse recovery, EMDR, somatic/grounding supports).
- Mood & stress management (anxiety, depression, burnout, boundary work, coping skills).
- Identity-affirming care (LGBTQIA+ therapy, women’s issues, reproductive health journeys, immigrant/refugee support).
- Adjacent specialties: ketamine-assisted therapy preparation/integration, telehealth logistics, psychoeducation-heavy sessions.

## Differentiators
- Openly progressive therapist who names systemic pressures and offers culturally responsive care.
- Emphasis on meeting clients “as-is” with humor, authenticity, and evidence-based structure.
- Teletherapy-first practice makes statewide access easy and highlights flexible, judgment-free scheduling.

## Key Proof Points & Social Credibility
- 10+ years clinical experience; trauma-focused training.
- Multiple directory badges (Inclusive Therapists, TherapyDen, Zencare) signal credibility and specialization.
- Free 15-minute consultation CTA repeated across legacy site—keep as primary conversion path.

## Operational Notes
- Primary contact: Blanca@progressivewaytherapy.com | 214-586-0357.
- Call-to-action targets: book free consult, request appointment, explore services.
- Keep telehealth-only disclaimer highly visible; clarify Texas-only service area.
- Imagery should center calm, modern aesthetics with inclusive representation (to be sourced later per image workflow).

## Section Usage Tracker
*Update this table after each page build. List section IDs exactly as they appear in `templates/clarity/sections.yaml`; if a block is missing from the catalog, record the `id` from `templates/clarity/template.html` and flag it in Notes. Use the `Hero Used` column to enforce the four-hero rotation. Mark a `1` in each section column when that block appears on the page so repeated patterns surface quickly. Include navigation and footer blocks once they are added site-wide.*

## Layout Rotation Checklist
- Before outlining a new page, review the two most recent entries above and choose at least one section ID that does **not** appear in either. If page requirements force a repeat, document the rationale in the Notes column when logging the new page.
- Confirm the `Hero Used` column cycles through all four hero variants. Flag any deviation (including `wds-parallax-section` slipping out of the hero slot) in the Notes column and adjust the next outline to rebalance.
- When a section column shows three consecutive `1`s, plan the next build to draw from a different layout family (services, story, CTA) before reusing that block again.

## Sections Remaining To Use
*Update this list after every page build so unused template sections stay front-and-center. When the list empties, immediately repopulate it with any sections that have appeared fewer than two times in the tracker above. Excludes navigation and footer components.*
- `wds-about-section`
- `wds-certification-section-1`
- `wds-testimonials-section-1`
- `wds-trust-section-2`
