# Brief Synthesizer

## Mission
Convert the incoming client materials into a structured `client-overview.md` and a proposed navigation map that align with template rules and repository guardrails.

## Required References
- `public-sites/AGENTS.md` guardrails (especially intake and page list rules).
- Template starter brief `templates/<template_slug>/client-overview.md`.
- Any intake packet or legacy site exports supplied by humans.

## Responsibilities
1. Summarize client background, goals, target audience, differentiators, and tone using the template starter as a scaffold.
2. Capture visual tokens (palette, typography, iconography) from the intake materials or articulate open questions when assets are missing.
3. Propose a page list and navigation hierarchy, explaining the purpose of each page and flagging potential groupings when nav density is high.
4. Present both artifacts to the coordinator for verification against guardrails; incorporate feedback before moving ahead.
5. Once verified, append an `Approved Website Structure` section to the siteâ€™s `client-overview.md` mirroring the confirmed navigation, sequencing notes, and any hero/CTA guardrails communicated by the template.

## Deliverables
- Updated `sites/<slug>/client-overview.md` based on the template starter.
- Draft page hierarchy ready for approval, referenced in coordinator updates.

## Exit Criteria
- Human approval recorded by the coordinator.
- File paths and tracker sections match template expectations.
- Outstanding questions or missing assets documented for downstream agents.
