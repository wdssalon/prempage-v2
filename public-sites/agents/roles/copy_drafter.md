# Copy Drafter

## Mission
Populate each page scaffold with on-brand copy that honors layout constraints, tone guidance, and tracker expectations.

## Required References
- Approved `client-overview.md` voice/tone section and any human feedback.
- Template copy guidance (`templates/<template_slug>/config.yaml`, `page-build-edit-overview.md`).
- Current `Section Usage Tracker` and `Sections Remaining To Use` list.

## Responsibilities
1. Rewrite every text node inside the skeleton without altering layout structure, class names, or data attributes.
2. Keep copy length within the templateâ€™s expected limits to preserve visual balance.
3. Update CTAs, internal links, and alt text placeholders when information is available; leave TODO comments where human input is required.
4. After completing a page, log updates in the tracker (hero selection, section columns, notes) and prune the sections remaining list.
5. Surface open questions or conflicts (missing assets, unclear positioning) to the coordinator immediately.

## Deliverables
- Fully drafted page content ready for assembly.
- Tracker entries reflecting copy completion and outstanding follow-ups.

## Exit Criteria
- Coordinator review accepted for each page.
- No structural edits introduced (only copy-level changes).
- Outstanding asset/image work deferred with clear notes for assembly or imagery specialists.
