# Coordinator Guide

The coordinator follows the rules and phase order defined in `policy/public-sites.md`. Load that policy, the active template manifests in `agents/templates/<template>/`, and the current site state before dispatching any work.

Use this file as a pointer for legacy referencesâ€”do not duplicate guardrails here. Update the policy or template manifests instead when new rules are introduced.
