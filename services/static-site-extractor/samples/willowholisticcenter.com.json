I decided to give Reiki a shot. I had two sessions with Carrie and OH MY GOD!! The pain started to subside and go away after session 1, and after session 2, the pain was even less. In addition, the days following both sessions, I found my energy levels to be higher than normal, and I found peace and quiet with some of the concerns I had going on in life - I found a hidden strength to deal with these concerns. I was not expecting anything other than helping with the pain in my shoulder. I am going to continue working with Carrie and her Reiki sessions."

I was too busy taking care of everyone over the years and forgot about myself. I guess I needed to see that and to have permission to take care of myself. Carrie helped me see this and gently guided me in achieving a goal of self-care. I have moved forward and am truly enjoying myself and my life by getting involved in activities that I love and had put aside."

Carrie has so many different analogies and expressions for better understanding yourself and others and I always leave my sessions feeling wiser and at-ease. I say this not for rhetorical purposes but with complete sincerity that I feel significantly more confident, happy, and empowered with my life since speaking with Carrie on a weekly basis."

After two years, this experience confirmed my intuition that this was my path. I returned to school and earned my Master\u2019s degree at Bryn Mawr School of Social Work in 2008 becoming a therapist in the Philadelphia area and fulfilling my dreams of what I wanted to be \u2018when I grew up.\u2019"

Through Reiki she has helped me heal and focus my life toward fulfillment of my goals. She has taught me that energy is all around us and that it can be channeled to affect your personal happiness and wellbeing. There is no one else that I would trust to help guide me on this path than Carrie. I highly recommend her services to help you find the clarity that you are striving for.\n\n-Bryan\n\nCarrie is wonderful. I appreciate her warmth and humor, and her holistic approach to healing and growth.\n\n-Mariah\n\nI highly recommend Carrie and Willow Holistic Center\u2026 I had been dealing with shoulder pain for several months (and sometimes quite painful), and no matter what I did, it would not go away. I decided to give Reiki a shot. I had two sessions with Carrie and OH MY GOD!! The pain started to subside and go away after session 1, and after session 2, the pain was even less. In addition, the days following both sessions, I found my energy levels to be higher than normal, and I found peace and quiet with some of the concerns I had going on in life - I found a hidden strength to deal with these concerns. I was not expecting anything other than helping with the pain in my shoulder. I am going to continue working with Carrie and her Reiki sessions.\n\n-Jeff\n\nMy life the last couple of years has been filled with anxiety due to circumstances out of my control. I needed to understand why this was happening and to take control of my life. Carrie took me through a thought process to help me see that what I needed which was self-care! I was too busy taking care of everyone over the years and forgot about myself. I guess I needed to see that and to have permission to take care of myself. Carrie helped me see this and gently guided me in achieving a goal of self-care. I have moved forward and am truly enjoying myself and my life by getting involved in activities that I love and had put aside.\n\n-Terry\n\nCarrie is the first therapist that help me to overcome a lifetime of pain and suffering. For the first time in many years I feel like my self again! \u2026 Carrie had me do several projects, taught me coping techniques, and was able to help me begin to reset the way I think about myself and deal with others. I am no longer taking medicine and I finally feel like my old self again.\n\n-Sarah\n\nI started meeting with Carrie virtually over 2 months ago. It was my first time ever speaking to a therapist so I felt unsure of how to proceed. Carrie\u2019s therapeutic experience and tender demeanor immediately stood out to me. I\u2019ve always felt comfortable speaking with her about anything and everything that is on my mind. Carrie has so many different analogies and expressions for better understanding yourself and others and I always leave my sessions feeling wiser and at-ease. I say this not for rhetorical purposes but with complete sincerity that I feel significantly more confident, happy, and empowered with my life since speaking with Carrie on a weekly basis.\n\n-John\n\nBackground\n\nHow Therapy Can Help\n\nMany who have tried traditional talk therapy alone still yearn for deeper healing.

I found this work unfulfilling and in 2003, I made a drastic change. I became a rape crisis counselor and a juvenile court victim advocate where I provided crisis response and supportive counseling. After two years, this experience confirmed my intuition that this was my path. I returned to school and earned my Master\u2019s degree at Bryn Mawr School of Social Work in 2008 becoming a therapist in the Philadelphia area and fulfilling my dreams of what I wanted to be \u2018when I grew up.\u2019\n\nLearn more\n\nBackground\n\nDon't Wait to Get the Help You Need\n\nStart Here\n\nBackground\n\nOur Recent Posts\n\nSlide\n\nMindful Monday | 4 Ways Self-Compassion Elevates Relationship Happiness\n\nRead More\n\nSlide\n\nMindful Mondays | 4 Steps to Hold Backdraft in Compassion\n\nRead More\n\nSlide\n\nMindful Mondays | Practice: Self Compassion Break\n\nRead More\n\nArrows\n\nMap Section\n\nNeed Help Finding the Office?\n\nGenesis Before Footer Action\n\nPre Footer Area\n\nSelect Footer Type\n\nFooter Type A ( Paris )\n\nAreas Served\n\nWillow Holistic Center, LLC offers virtual and in person therapy in the suburban Philadelphia, PA region and is located in Devon, less than a mile from the Strafford Train Station.
